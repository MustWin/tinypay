Tinypay is powered by the blockchain, so transaction fees are always low (but not free, due to [the nature of Ethereum](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#gas)). Once you have Tinypay properly installed on your website, your users will just click on our Tinypay buttons to reveal paid content on your website. Funds will automatically transfer into your contract account and you can withdraw them at any time. This is new technology, so it requires a browser that supports [Web3](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API).
