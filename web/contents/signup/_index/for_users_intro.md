Tinypay is powered by the blockchain, so transaction fees are always low. Once you have Tinypay, you'll just click on our Tinypay buttons around the internet to reveal content from participating media companies. This is new technology, so it requires a browser that supports [Web3](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API).
